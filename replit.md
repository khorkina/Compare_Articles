# Wiki Truth - Privacy-First Wikipedia Comparison Platform

## Overview

Wiki Truth is a freemium web application that enables users to compare Wikipedia articles across multiple languages using artificial intelligence. The platform offers both free and premium tiers - free users get Meta Llama AI analysis while premium subscribers ($5/month) receive OpenAI GPT-4o analysis with enhanced features. The platform is designed with privacy-first principles, storing all user data locally in the browser while revealing how the same topic can be presented differently in various linguistic and cultural contexts.

- **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Assets**: Client bundle served by Express in production
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Optional environment variable for PostgreSQL connection (using in-memory storage by default)
