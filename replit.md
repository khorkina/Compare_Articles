# Wiki Truth - Privacy-First Wikipedia Comparison Platform

## Overview

Wiki Truth is a completely free web application that enables users to compare Wikipedia articles across multiple languages using artificial intelligence. The platform is designed with privacy-first principles, storing all user data locally in the browser while revealing how the same topic can be presented differently in various linguistic and cultural contexts, providing insights into cultural biases and narrative variations. No subscription or registration required.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Wikipedia-inspired design system
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework (minimal server for static files only)
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built React application
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Client Storage**: IndexedDB with idb library for structured data
- **User Accounts**: UUID-based accounts stored in browser localStorage with subscription tracking
- **Session Management**: Local browser storage only
- **Subscription Management**: Local browser storage with 30-day validation
- **Privacy**: No server-side data storage or tracking

## Key Components

### Search and Discovery System
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Direct API integration with Wikipedia's OpenSearch and LangLinks APIs
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search with autocomplete suggestions
- **Multi-language Support**: 35+ supported languages with native name display
- **Article Selection**: Type-ahead search with snippet previews

### AI Comparison Engine
- **Model**: OpenRouter.ai with Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (free model)
- **Comparison Modes**: Standard academic analysis and "funny mode" for entertaining insights
- **Content Processing**: Browser-to-server-to-OpenRouter API communication (CORS bypass)
- **Cultural Analysis**: Focus on factual differences, framing variations, and cultural perspectives
- **Access Control**: Completely free for all users, no subscription required

### Export and Sharing
- **Document Export**: DOCX generation using docx library
- **Comparison Reports**: Formatted documents with metadata and analysis
- **Share Functionality**: URL-based sharing of comparison results

### User Interface Components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with grid-based layouts
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback system for actions and errors
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and progress indicators

## Data Flow

1. **User Initialization**: UUID-based account automatically created and stored in localStorage
2. **Article Search**: Direct browser calls to Wikipedia API with CORS proxy
3. **Language Discovery**: Wikipedia language links fetched client-side
4. **Language Selection**: User chooses 2-5 languages for comparison
5. **Content Retrieval**: Multiple Wikipedia articles fetched directly in browser
6. **AI Processing**: Direct browser-to-OpenAI API calls for comparison analysis
7. **Local Storage**: Results saved to IndexedDB with full user control
8. **Privacy Compliance**: No server-side data storage or user tracking

## External Dependencies

### APIs and Services
- **Wikipedia API**: Direct client-side calls for article search, language links, and content retrieval
- **OpenRouter.ai API**: Server-side calls to free Llama models for article comparison and analysis
- **CORS Proxy**: AllOrigins service for bypassing browser CORS restrictions with Wikipedia

### Development and Build Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool with React plugin and development server
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database schema management and migrations
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for server-side code

### UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Headless component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Libre Baskerville font family

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with React Fast Refresh
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL or Neon development instance
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and database URLs via .env

### Production Build
- **Client Build**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Assets**: Client bundle served by Express in production
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Optional environment variable for PostgreSQL connection (using in-memory storage by default)
- **OpenRouter API Key**: Required for free AI comparison functionality
- **Node Environment**: Development/production mode switching
